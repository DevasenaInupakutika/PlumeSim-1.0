  LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and PKG_CONFIG_PATH

  In the PlumeSim-1.0 source directory, run "make" from your command line.
  If everything is set up correctly, libPlumeSim.so should be created.

RUN PLUMESIM:
  Simulation files adapted from simple.cfg and simple.world distributed with
  Stage 3.2.2.  cave.png, sick.inc, pioneer.inc, and map.inc copied from
  Stage 3.2.2 distribution.  http://playerstage.sourceforge.net

  Be sure to have Stage 3.2.x and Player 3.0.x installed. Navigate to
  the "simulation" directory and run
  
  player PlumeSim.cfg

  from your command line.  This should start a PlumeSim simulation.
  Modify PlumeSim.cfg to change the PlumeSim driver parameters.
